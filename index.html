    <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
    <h2>Data Architect <span>|</span> Charity Trustee <span>|</span> BCS Board Member</h2><br>
    <p>As a <span><b>Data Architect</b></span>, I specialise in designing and maintaining robust data infrastructures while setting critical policies for data protection, retention, and ethics. My journey began as a Data Analyst, where I honed my skills in data presentation, developing a passion for delivering clear and impactful insights. This passion continues to drive my approach to data strategy and communication today.</p><br>
    <p>To complement and expand my data expertise, I am currently studying Data Science at <span><b>BPP University</b></span>, further enriching my skills and rounding out my data skillset.</p><br>
    <p>Beyond my professional role, I am deeply committed to using my expertise to make a meaningful difference. As a trustee for two <span><b>LGBTQIA+ Charities</b></span>, I leverage my knowledge in data, technology, finance, and strategic risk management to support their growth and amplify their impact within the community. Serving as <span><b>Treasurer and Risk Committee Chair</b></span> in these organisations allows me to apply sound financial oversight and risk mitigation strategies to advance their missions.</p><br>
    <p>My commitment to positive change in the tech industry extends through my active involvement with the <span><b>British Computer Society</b></span>. As a member of the BCS Community Board and Policy Engagement Officer on the Early Careers Executive Committee, I am devoted to promoting diversity in technology and ensuring that IT serves the greater good across the UK.</p><br>
    <p>Driven by a passion for impactful data storytelling and a commitment to inclusive leadership, I strive to bridge technology and community to foster meaningful progress.</p>
